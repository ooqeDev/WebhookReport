This is a Report plugin for Minecraft servers which adds a /report command to the game and you can customize the entire report GUI which includes things like renaming the items, 
changing the items, and much more. You can add your discord webhook in the code so when the players use the command, the report goes to the staff members in discord server. 
You can also add the tag "staff" to staff members using the vanilla command, /tag so whoever has that tag can see the reports submitted in-game as well, mostly meant for staff members.
